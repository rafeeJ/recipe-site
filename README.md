# Jenkins-Keyworth Home App
Recipe Site and Inventory for my home.

# What is this?
I have recently moved into a new flat with my partner, and we like to organise our weekly meals quite rigorously. I thought I would create an app that could keep a track of the food that we have in the house, as well as the meals that we have planned.

# What tech is used? 
I am using Docker, MongoDB and Python3. 
### Why this?
I have used JavaScript/TypeScript a lot recently, so I thought I would try to get a hang of writing up logic in a different language. I used Docker quite a lot on placement, but I didn't really fully understand how to use it properly. This app is an oppurtunity to Dockerise everything and learn on the way.

# Plans for the app
I would like to have a few Docker containers on this app that would be used on the regular (E.G Kodi), and would use the flask app to navigate the app effectively. 

I want to design the web app for the iPhone, so that my partner can use it properly.
